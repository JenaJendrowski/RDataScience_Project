# Introduction
Historically, hate-groups were prominent in communities with white majority populations with a marginalized racial minority group. (Beck, 2000). Hate groups in the past were more commonly forming in material communities, but now with the rise in Internet Communication Technologies (ICTâ€™s) are fostering hateful communities online.  


# The Big Question

Which material conditions are relevant to producing raciest rhetoric on Twitter? (Income, education attainment)  What are the demographics of the geographic area surrounding online hate-speech activists, compared to the demographics of hate-groups existing in the material environment?

# Methodology

Here's my first code chunk.
```{r}
Nword <- read.csv(file = "Nword.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

NWordHate<-subset(Nword, Hate==1)

NewNword=select(NWordHate, latitude, longitude, Hate)
edit(NewNword)


usa <- map_data("usa")
ggplot() + geom_polygon(data = usa, aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  geom_point(data=NewNword, aes(x=longitude, y=latitude), color="red", size = .2) +
  coord_fixed(1.3)
```

Load any required packages in a code chunk (you may need to install some packages):

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

```
