# Introduction
Historically, hate-groups were prominent in communities with white majority populations with a marginalized racial minority group. (Beck, 2000). Hate groups in the past were more commonly forming in material communities, but now with the rise in Internet Communication Technologies (ICTâ€™s) are fostering hateful communities online.  


# The Big Question

Which material conditions are relevant to producing raciest rhetoric on Twitter? (Income, interracial marriage, employment, education)  What are the demographics of the geographic area surrounding online hate-speech activists, compared to the demographics of hate-groups existing in the material environment?

# Methodology

Here's my first code chunk.
```{r}
Nword <- read.csv(file = "Nword.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

NWordHate<-subset(Nword, Hate==1)

NewNword=select(NWordHate, latitude, longitude, Hate)
edit(NewNword)


usa <- map_data("usa")
ggplot() + geom_polygon(data = usa, aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  geom_point(data=NewNword, aes(x=longitude, y=latitude), color="red", size = .2) +
  coord_fixed(1.3)
```

Load any required packages in a code chunk (you may need to install some packages):

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

```



```{r, warning=F} 
## define which species to query
sp='Turdus migratorius'

## run the query and convert to data.frame()
d = occ(query=sp, from='ebird',limit = 100) %>% occ2df()
```
This can take a few seconds.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Map illustrating the known occurrence locations"}
# Load coastline
map=map_data("world")

ggplot(d,aes(x=longitude,y=latitude))+
  geom_polygon(aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group),data=map)+
  geom_point(col="red")+
  coord_equal()
```
